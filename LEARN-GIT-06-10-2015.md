## WANT TO LEARN GIT?
Git allows groups of people to work on the same documents (often code) at the same time, 
and without stepping on each other's toes. It's a distributed version control system.

Our terminal prompt below is currently in a directory we decided to name "octobox". 
To initialize a Git repository here, type the following command:
```
git init
```
