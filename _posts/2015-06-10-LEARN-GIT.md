Git allows groups of people to work on the same documents at the same time, and without stepping on each other's toes. It's a distributed version control system.

git init

Next up, let's type the git status command to see what the current state of our project is:
```
git status
```

I created a file called **octocat.txt** in the **octobox repository** for you.

You should run the git status command again to see how the repository status has changed:
