### 1. Google SpreadSheets:
  Firstly, you have to create a Google SpreadSheet file. You can store any data that you want as long as it has longtitudes and latitudes available for google maps.
  
 This is the spreadsheet example that I use for this project:

### 2. Install Bower and Polymer

#### Install Bower:
  Bower is a package manager for the web.
  
  - Download and install Node.js from nodejs.org
  - Use command line to install Bower:  npm install -g bower (-g: to make Bower globally available in the system )
  - Create new folder that runs Bower : mkdir my-project
  - bower init
