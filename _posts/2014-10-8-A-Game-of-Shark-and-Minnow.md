title: A Game of Shark and Minnow
---



A Game of Shark and Minnow is a piece of magazine journalism translated into a multimedia presentation. The readers experience a new interactive feature which is graphically compelling and sophisticated spatial storytelling.

I think this is a a great idea to keep readers in an active mode through the whole article, especially with the long article like "A game of Shark and minnow". The balance of text, photo and video creates a comfortable flow. The three media platforms to move the story forward, maintaining a readerâ€™s attention and signifying transition points. 

I can say the desktop experience as the one that is probably the best. I experiment the webiste on my laptop and on the bigger screen size. The scrolling paralax effect in Safari is pretty smooth. By the way, it is a little bit "slow" in Firefox and Chrome when I scroll down. 

By the way, the scrolling experiment, video and sound are no longer on tablet and mobile devices. There is only still photographs that I think they are powerful enough for mobile performance but it would be great to have same experience everywhere. 

Even though I really enjoy the experience with this interactive article, I feel it can have some improvement 
personally, I am not a big fan with the sound loop over and over. I feel like it interupts me

I think it's really thoughtful to have the bullet points on the right side. It lets you know the number of scrolling images that you will have.
