title: A Game of Shark and Minnow
---
A Game of Shark and Minnow is a piece of magazine journalism translated into a multimedia presentation. The readers experience a new interactive feature which is graphically compelling and sophisticated spatial storytelling.

I think this is a a great idea to keep readers in an active mode through the whole article, especially with the long article like "A game of Shark and minnow". The balance of text, photo and video creates a comfortable flow. The three media platforms to move the story forward, maintaining a readerâ€™s attention and signifying transition points. By the way, there is some thoughts about the bullet points on the right side. The good point is the readers can prevent the transition in between images/videos and text. The bad thing is that these bullet points give inaccurate information about the amount of content that is left to load and readers feel cheated and annoyed when they realize there is still more to come.

I can say the desktop experience as the one that is probably the best. I experiment the webiste on my laptop and on the bigger screen size. The scrolling paralax effect in Safari is pretty smooth. By the way, it is a little bit "slow" in Firefox and Chrome when I scroll down. However, the scrolling experiment, video, and sound are no longer on tablet and mobile devices. There is only still photographs that I think they are powerful enough for mobile performance but it would be great to have same experience everywhere. 

Even though I really enjoy the experience with this interactive article, I feel it can have some improvements.
Firstly, the sound looping over and over somehow interupts my reading. I think it would be better if it just plays once when you scroll down. Secondly, I think they can do a better job with the navigation. Instead of using numbers, they can give titles to each section so it's easier to navigate.
