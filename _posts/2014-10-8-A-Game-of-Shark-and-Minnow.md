###Overview

A Game of Shark and Minnow is a piece of magazine journalism translated into a multimedia presentation. The readers experience a new interactive feature which is graphically compelling and sophisticated spatial storytelling.

### Experience from a reader
I think this is a very creative idea to keep readers in an active mode through the whole article. The balance of text, photo and video creates a comfortable flow.The three media platforms to move the story forward, maintaining a readerâ€™s attention and signifying transition points. 

I can say the desktop experience as the one that is probably the best.
I experiment the webiste on my laptop and on the bigger screen size, the web performance is pretty good
By the way, the scrolling experiment, video and sound are no longer on tablet and mobile devices. They area only still photographs that I think they are powerful enough for mobile performance but it would be great to have same experience everywhere.
