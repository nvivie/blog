At first, I have conflicting feelings about Web Components. I am very excited and very nervous.

This is pretty new and different way of adding new features to browsers. With web components, they give developers much more power than they had before. Web components are encapsulated, reusable and composable widgets for the web platform. That sounds pretty awesome. You can extend existing elements by customizing your own custom elements are also just HTML elements. 
Creating your own HTML element seems actually quite easy. The only two requirements are that its name must contain a dash, and its prototype must extend HTMLElement. You can name whatever you want as long as it makes sense to you and it helps your code more readable. I am also very excited about the shadow DOM even though I don't entirely get the whole concept yet.

Since Web Components are the new hotness, I am afraid that it might be a rocky transition to this new way of thinking. Also I have a bad feeling about browser support. Although web components landed in Chrome 36, they only have partial support in Firefox, and they are not here for Safari and IE. It probably is one of the reason that web components are not ready for production.
