At first, I was confusing of what the web components can do. 
I have conflicting feelings about Web Components. I am very excited and very nervous. Thatâ€™s probably a good sign.
This is pretty new and different way of adding features to browsers.With web components, it gives developers much more power that they had before. The exciting thing about web component is the custom elements, which lets authors define their own elements. 
One of the biggest things that come with web components, is the fact that you can extend existing elements. And since your own custom elements are also just HTML elements, you can extend them as well as native elements. From a surface point of view there's no difference between native elements and custom elements.
