## Example of working with local repo from git

### nvivie.github.io example - fresh start: 
[https://github.com/nvivie/nvivie.github.io]

..1. In Github, create a new branch called 'dev'. All the changes will be working under dev branch. Once you are done with changes, you can merge and push it master branch.

..2. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.

..3. Under your repository name, copy the clone URL for the repository

..4. Open Terminal, use <cd> to navigate to your folder.

..5. In order to work on changes, you have to CLONE the project to your machine. 
In Terminal, navigate to the folder that you want to save the local repo.

  ```
  cd Documents 
  git clone https_url_of_github_repo
  ex: git clone https://github.com/nvivie/nvivie.github.io.git
  ```

..6. CHECKOUT 'dev' branch. This is a very important step. Make sure you work on the right branch to avoid override someone files.

  ```
  git checkout dev
  ```

..7. To checkout your branch that you are currently working

  ```
  git checkout -b newBranchName
  ```

..8. To switch to master branch

  ```
  git checkout master
  ```

..9. Testing: modify a small change in your file in Sublime. Save it


..10. In Terminal, navigate to the local repo folder so it will only watch for changes in that folder.

  ```
  cd nvivie.nguyen.io
  ```

..11. Then, ADD (+) the changed file.

  ```
  git add index.html
  ```

..12. Commit a message

  ```
  git commit -m"writing a message"
  ```

..13.Push to dev branch

  ```
  git push origin dev
  ```
