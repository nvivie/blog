title: Outdated Browsers

### Should we just leave older browsers such as IE9 and lower out of equation of new web technologies ?


### Why do people still use such outdated browsers? Is it always their fault? How should they be handled?
 There are too many reasons and there is more than one way to look at the problem.
 First of all, for personal use, not everyone cares about upgrade their browser to the latest version until they have to. Everyone has a different comfort and passion level with technology. If something just works fine for someone, or they know how to use it, they are more likely to stick with it. If you are not a tech savvy or working in web field, users probably won't think of switching from IE to Chrome if they don't see a need or benefit.  , it takes a lot of effort for them to try some new technology thing. When things get changed, they get really confused and it's hard for them to get use to the changes
 
  If it's enterprise, like a big company, the problem is twofold: Licensing for all those machines, and secondly, all the software they have written is designed to work for that specific browser, so upgrading means starting all the development work again for all their programs.

For personal use: Not everyone cares about upgrading until they actually do it. Because you and I are in this tech/design/development bubble, we tend to forget that not everyone knows or cares about what's new.

###  Should you spend development time and money supporting an ever-shrinking, outdated user base?
### Can you afford to forget about them as potential customers?
