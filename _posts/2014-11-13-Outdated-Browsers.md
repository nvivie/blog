title: Outdated Browsers

### Should we just leave older browsers such as IE9 and lower out of equation of new web technologies ?


### Why do people still use such outdated browsers? Is it always their fault? How should they be handled?
 There are too many reasons and there is more than one way to look at the problem.
 First of all, for personal use, not everyone cares about upgrade their browser to the latest version until they have to. Everyone has a different comfort and passion level with technology. If something just works fine for someone, or they know how to use it, they are more likely to stick with it and they won't even know what they are missing by using the old browsers. If you are not a tech savvy or working in web field, you probably won't see the benefits of switching from IE to Chrome. Moreover, we can not forget our older generation customers, it takes a lot of effort for them to try some new technology thing. When things get changed, they get really confused and it's hard for them to get use to the changes.
 
  If it's enterprise, like a big company, the problem is twofold: Licensing for all those machines, and secondly, all the software they have written is designed to work for that specific browser, so upgrading means starting all the development work again for all their programs. It will cost money for the company and it will have a hard transition and frustration for employees trying to learn and use comfortably the new software.
  The good news is the number of people using the older browsers is going down, because companies are forcing the evolution, plus those companies with the older computers eventually upgrade because their tech just becomes to slow to do the jobs they need.

###  Should you spend development time and money supporting an ever-shrinking, outdated user base?
### Can you afford to forget about them as potential customers?
