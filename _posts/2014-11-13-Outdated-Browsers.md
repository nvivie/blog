title: Outdated Browsers

### Why do people still use such outdated browsers? Is it always their fault? How should they be handled?
 There are too many reasons and there is more than one way to look at the problem.
 
 First of all, for personal use, not everyone cares about upgrade their browser to the latest version until they have to. Everyone has a different comfort and passion level with technology. If something just works fine for someone, or they know how to use it, they are more likely to stick with it and they won't even know what they are missing by using the old browsers. If you are not a tech savvy, you probably won't see the benefits of switching from IE to Chrome. Moreover, with the older audiences like my grandparents and my parents, it takes a lot of effort for them to try some new technology thing. When things get changed, they get really confused and it's hard for them to get use to the changes.
 
  If it's enterprise, like a big company, employees have to use the old browsers because they have to. Now we see the problem is: Licensing for all those machines, and secondly, all the software they have written is designed to work for that specific browser, so upgrading means starting all the development work again for all their programs. It will cost money for the company and it will have a hard transition and frustration for employees trying to learn and use comfortably the new software. Moreover, big companies are slow to change, that has always been true.
  
  The good news is the number of people using the older browsers is going down, because companies are forcing the evolution, plus those companies with the older computers eventually upgrade because their tech just becomes to slow to do the jobs they need.
  
### Should we just leave older browsers such as IE9 and below out of equation of new web technologies?

 In the real world, Internet Explorer still exists. Older versions still do things that confound and inflame us. And plenty of people still use them. IE6 still is in China. Designing and developing websites here is a fallback plans nightmare because an estimated 30% of China’s gigantic online population is using IE6 or local browsers based on its core, according to web browser market share in China http://blog.mozilla.org/gen/2009/09/15/web-browser-marketshare-in-china/. 
 
 The root cause of this massive problem are Chinese banks: their e-banking interface are almost entirely made with Internet Explorer in mind and use plenty of ActiveX components. 
 
 Let's have a look at the browser market share. Almost 26% people still use IE 8 and 9 in the world, if we leave the older browsers like IE9 and below behind. That means we will lose one third of our potential audiences.

###  Should you spend development time and money supporting an ever-shrinking, outdated user base?

 I have been through the moment I pull my hair out over my broken portoflio page in IE8 while everything works fine in Chrome, Firefox and Safari. I wasted endless hours developing for IE. Then I realized that my potential customers or audiences that I aim to probably don't use IE.
 
 I’m not suggesting that anyone stop developing for IE altogether. Though developers don’t generally care for it, a fair portion of users do – nearly 30 per cent. Rather, I’m suggesting methods to make development more efficient and worthwhile, so time spent developing for IE is productive rather than wasteful.
 
 Before you write a line of code, check your analytics to determine what percentage of your audience actually uses it. If it’s a minuscule amount, is it worth the hours of time spent developing for them? Could that time be better spent polishing your site for browsers that customers actually use?
 
 If clients who insist on developing for an outdated browser, no matter what their visitors are using. It's simple, just charge for it because you will have to do double as much work for this browser. At least, you will have enough motivation to do it without hating them. And also encourage your clients to update to the newer browsers.
