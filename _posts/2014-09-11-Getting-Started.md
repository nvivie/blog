## Why I'm Here
Originally I started out wanting to be a designer. I graduated in Visual Communication Multimedia.
I have been working for few advertising companies in packaging design, advertising campaigns, brandings...
I started to feel I need to learn something for the web since most of my clients started asking me
 if I could do their websites. I was able to edit some simple stuff in html only.

As the websites got more sophisticated I found myself digging into code view to make things work and look right. 
I started learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and C language. I figured out that I love messing around with my code and my design.
Thats where I found my passion.
