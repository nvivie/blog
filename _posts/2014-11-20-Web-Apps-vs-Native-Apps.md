title: Web Apps vs Native Apps
---

### What is a web app and what is a native app?
A Native App is an app developed essentially for one particular mobile device and is installed directly onto the device itself. Users of native apps usually download them via app stores online or the app marketplace, such as the Apple App Store, the Google Play store and so on. For example Safari on iPhone is a native app.

A Web App, on the other hand, are basically Internet-enabled apps that are accessible via the mobile device’s Web browser. They don't need to be downloaded onto the user’s mobile device in order to be accessed.

###Pros and cons of a <strong>WEB APP</strong>:

#### Pros:
- The web apps have the convenience of being used on various devices with the only requirement being on a browser and have an internet connection.
- Web apps can update by itself without the need for user's intervention.
- Web apps use languages such as JavaScript, HTML 5, CSS3 or other Web application frameworks. So basically, web apps are like responsible websites. You adjust and modify some features in order to provide a good overall user experience.

####Cons:
- Need a native app to run
- Poor user experience, lack of acces to native device features such as location, camera, calendar and so on.

###Pros and cons of a <strong>NATIVE APP</strong>:

####Pros:
- The benefits of the native app is that it can work independently with and without internet.
- Web apps run in browsers and browsers are native apps, like Safari app. So anything a web app can do is possible because of a native app.
- You can make money on native apps everytime users download them.
- Native apps are more expensive to develop. However, they are more efficient and faster.
- A native app is totally compatible with the device’s hardware and native features, such as accelerometer, camera and so on

####Cons:
  - Users have to keep downloading updates.
  - Each native app uses difference programming languages. iOs uses Objective-C to develop in XCode and Android uses Java.

### Conclusion 
Personally, I side with web apps. For small businesses or a new web developper who wants to build an app, I would say web apps will save you more time and money.Especially, there are more tools for building and monitoring web apps on phones and tablets. And the cost of building mobile web apps versus hiring engineers or an agency to build two or three or four native apps is pretty irresistible.

By the way, if you or your client are looking for a efficiency, a productivity and a good performance(speed, appearance), then a native app will make more sense.
