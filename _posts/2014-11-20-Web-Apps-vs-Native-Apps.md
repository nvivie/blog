title: Web Apps vs Native Apps
---

### What is a web app and a native app?
A Native App is an app developed essentially for one particular mobile device and is installed directly onto the device itself. Users of native apps usually download them via app stores online or the app marketplace, such as the Apple App Store, the Google Play store and so on.

A Web App, on the other hand, are basically Internet-enabled apps that are accessible via the mobile device’s Web browser. They need not be downloaded onto the user’s mobile device in order to be accessed.

###Pros and cons
#### Pros:






### Conclusion 
Personally, I side with web apps. Most programmers can handle the technologies behind it, and there are more tools for building and monitoring web apps on phones and tablets. And the cost of building mobile web apps versus hiring engineers or an agency to build two or three or four native apps is pretty irresistible.
