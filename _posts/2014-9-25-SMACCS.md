### LOVE SMACSS
Finally I found a solution for my unorganized CSS. My CSS files are always messy and out of control. Sometimes, I just rewrite the whole style just for a small change. With SMACCS, my CSS will be better organization of rules so that the workflow is going smoother and the style are repeated less. I am thinking of reorganizing my portfolio webiste with SMACCS. Wish me luck!

### Could it be improved?
This is just my personal opinion. I think SMACCS can be improved because nowadays stylesheets get more and more complicated.
For a sophisticated website, having 4 or 5 categories is pretty limitted. I understand the state rule is a way to describe how layouts or modules look when in different states by using the prefix "is".
It can be extended by using prefix "has" as well if the categories have sub-categories and sub-sub categories. It is just an easier way to know in which these child elements belong to.

I think I've heard of OOCSS but I am not sure if it does the same functionality like SMACCS.
